# mock-generator-graphql
A code generator plugin for creating stubs of an API

- **GraphQL**: I have used open graphql playground url for countries https://countries.trevorblades.com/

## Context

This is the practical demo for generating the mock data (__files) and mappings for graphql based applications.

## Add mappings

Add mappings and configurations in codegen.yml file to generate the mocks

## How to generate the mocks

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies 

Run `npm run build:watch` to generate the mock folder. You can find the mappings and files generated in this folder.

├── mock                            
    ├── __files                     # Generated mock json files 
    ├── mappings                    # Generate mapping based on codegen.yml file
